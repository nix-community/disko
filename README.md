NixOS is a Linux distribution where everything is described as code, with one exception: during installation, the disk partitioning and formatting are manual steps. **disko** aims to correct this sad ðŸ¤¡ omission.

This is especially useful for unattended installations, re-installation after a system crash or for setting up more than one identical server.

## Overview

**disko** can either be used after booting from a NixOS installer, or in conjunction with [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/numtide/nixos-anywhere) if you're installing remotely.

Before using **disko**, the specifications of the disks, partitions, type of formatting and the mount points must be defined in a Nix configuration. You can find [examples](./example) of typical configurations in the Nix community repository, and use one of these as the basis of your own configuration.

You can keep your configuration and re-use it for other installations, or for a system rebuild.

**disko** is flexible, in that it supports most of the common formatting and partitioning options, including:

- Disk layouts: GPT, MBR, and mixed.
- Partition tools: LVM, mdadm, LUKS, and more.
- Filesystems: ext4, btrfs, ZFS, bcachefs, tmpfs, and others.

It can work with these in various configurations and orders, and supports recursive layouts.

## How to use disko

Disko doesn't require installation: it can be run directly from nix-community repository. The [Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart.md) documents how to run Disko in its simplest form when installing NixOS.

For information on other use cases, including upgrading from an older version of **disko**, using **disko** without NixOS and downloading the module, see the [How To Guide](./docs/HowTo.md)

For more detailed options, such as command line switches, see the [Reference Guide](./docs/reference.md)

To access sample configurations for commonly-used disk layouts, refer to the [examples](./example) provided.

## Sample Configuration and CLI command

A simple disko configuration may look like this:

```
{ disks ? [ "/dev/vdb" ], ... }: {
 disk = {
 Â vdb = {
 Â  device = builtins.elemAt disks 0;
 Â  type = "disk";
 Â  content = {
 Â  Â type = "gpt";
 Â  Â partitions = {
 Â  Â  ESP = {
 Â  Â  Â size = "100M";
 Â  Â  Â content = {
 Â  Â  Â  type = "filesystem";
 Â  Â  Â  format = "vfat";
 Â  Â  Â  mountpoint = "/boot";
 Â  Â  Â };
 Â  Â  };
 Â  Â  root = {
 Â  Â  Â size = "100%";
 Â  Â  Â content = {
 Â  Â  Â  type = "filesystem";
 Â  Â  Â  format = "ext4";
 Â  Â  Â  mountpoint = "/";
 Â  Â  Â };
 Â  Â  };
 Â  Â };
 Â  };
 Â };
 };
}
```

If you'd saved this configuration in /tmp/disko-config.nix, and wanted to create a disk named /dev/nvme0n1, you would run the following command to partition, format and mount the disk.

```
$ sudo nix run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode disko /tmp/disko-config.nix --arg disks '[ "/dev/nvme0n1" ]'
```
